# YouTube-Playlist-liker-and-commenter
This Python script allows you to automate interactions with YouTube playlists. Specifically, it authenticates with your Google account and then likes and comments on videos within a specified playlist. This can be useful for engaging with content creators and their audiences in a systematic way.

**Prerequisites**

Before you can use this script, you'll need the following:

Google API Credentials: You must have a credentials.json file obtained from the Google Developers Console. This file is used for authentication.

Python Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using **pip**:

```
pip install google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client tkinter
```
Google API Access: You need to enable the "YouTube Data API v3" for your project on the Google Developers Console.

**Usage**

Clone this repository or download the script.

Place your credentials.json file in the same directory as the script.

Customize the script as needed (e.g., adjust the rate limits, comments, etc.).

Run the script:

```
python playlist_automator.py
```


This will initiate the authentication process, and once authorized, it will start liking and commenting on videos within the specified playlist.

Script Details
Here's an overview of the main functions in the script:

authenticate_and_get_service(credentials_file)
This function authenticates with Google using the provided credentials_file and returns a YouTube API service instance.

like_and_comment_videos(service, playlist_id, comments)
This function likes and comments on videos within the specified playlist:

service: The YouTube API service instance.
playlist_id: The ID of the YouTube playlist you want to interact with.
comments: A list of comments to post. The script cycles through these comments.
The script also includes rate limiting to avoid hitting API rate limits too quickly.

Customization
Feel free to customize this script to suit your needs. You can adjust the rate limits, comments, or even add more functionality based on the YouTube API documentation.

Please ensure you use this script responsibly and respect YouTube's policies and guidelines. Unauthorized or excessive use may result in account restrictions.

For more information on the YouTube Data API and its capabilities, refer to the YouTube API documentation.

Note: This script is provided as-is and may require updates if the YouTube API or its libraries change in the future. Always use the latest version of libraries and follow best practices for security and authentication.
